## Intro To Java
A Java program can be characterized as an **object** represented in a **class**.
Currently our program has a Main object. Inside of this object, we have the Main class.

## Output
In java to output the item to the console, we use: `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()`
Second one prints the statement and moves to the next line, while the first one just prints the statement


## Comments
A comment is used as user annotation with the purpose of being human readable. **Line Comments** follow double backslashes. `//`
**Block Comments** are contained within `Comments`.

## Identifiers
In Java use the term **indentifer** to describe a variable, parameter, constant, user-defined method, or user-defined class.

*Note: *
- Class names start with a capital letter
- reserved words are entirely lowercase and may not be used as indentifers (Reserved words will show up in blue)

## Types
**Primitive** or **built-in** types in Java are:
- `ints` or an integer
- `boolean` True or False

## Variables
We can create varibales by using **decleration**
- `int` age
- `double x and y`
- `boolean`
- `char` letter

## Type Cast

One type can be cast to another compliable type if appopriate.

`char letter` = 'c'
